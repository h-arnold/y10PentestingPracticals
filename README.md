# Pentesting Practicals for Schools
This repository has a selection of resources used to allow KS4 (GCSE - Age 14-16) students to learn about Pentesting. It is designed to complement Unit 1.4 of the OCR J277 GCSE spec.

###Benefits
 - Your students will actually get to *do* some of the attacks they learn about.
 - They are designed to run separately to the main school network - sidestepping most safeguarding concerns.
 - Set up takes minutes (once you've done it once)
 - Very low hardware requirements - i.e. cheap.

Each practical is build around different Slax modules, which is a linux distribution designed to be run from a USB stick on low-powered machines. This means that you can run these practicals from any old laptops you have knocking around and the student machines can be booted from a 1GB USB stick which keeps things really cheap.

While the initial setup will take a couple of hours, once you have familiarised yourself with the process, it's very straightforward and new practicals can be set up in minutes.

## You will need

- A selection of old computers, ideally laptops. They need at least 1GB of RAM and the ability to boot from a USB stick. Secure boot needs to be switched off.
- Some USB sticks.
- A wifi router for the laptops to connect to.
- Balena Etcher (free software for cloning USB sticks)
- Some time to get your head around the process


## Safeguarding

As teachers, we have an extra responsibility  to ensure that we are safeguarding our students against getting themselves (and each other) into trouble as well as safeguarding the school network as a whole. It should go without saying that schools hold **a lot** of personal data on all sorts of things and the consequences for a data breach or accidental wipe would be catastropic. It is impreative therefore, that you take **all** necessary steps to ensure that you conduct these practicals in as safe a manner as possible, much in the same way that science teachers ensure that students handle dangerous chemicals and a whole variety of very sharp, hot, cold, electrical and heavy things.

With that in mind, these are the steps I have taken to ensure that everything is conducted safely:

1. All practicals take place offline (i.e. not connected to the internet) on an entirely separate network to the school network. An old router is perfect for this job.
2. All student facing tools are ephemeral - i.e. once you've finished using the tools, students have no way of accessing them. I've done this by creating a selection of Slax images that are distributed on USB sticks. Nothing touches the HDs of the devices they're using and nothing touches the school network.
    - I recommend you clone the student USB sticks from the original image after each practical. Just to be safe.
3. Students only get access to the tools they need for their practical. I've created Slax images for each tool they need for each practical and each one *only* has the tools they need. For example, the brute force attack practical only has Hydra installed. The DDoS practical only has HOIC installed.
4. Target machines have nothing of value stored on them. Once again, you'll find Slax images for each of the target machines - these contain the servers required and nothing else. There are no credentials worth stealing.
    - I recommend you run the server images in RAM so that even if a prodigious student does manage to go beyond the scope of the activity, nothing is changed.
