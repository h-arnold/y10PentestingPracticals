# Pentesting Practicals for Schools
This repository has a selection of resources used to allow KS4 (GCSE - Age 14-16) students to learn about Pentesting. It is designed to complement Unit 1.4 of the OCR J277 GCSE spec.

In it, you will find virtual machine images (all open-source software) to use as servers to be hacked and Slax modules with the tools needed for each lesson.
