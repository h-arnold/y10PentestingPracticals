# Pentesting Practicals for Schools
This repository has a selection of resources used to allow KS4 (GCSE - Age 14-16) students to learn about Pentesting. It is designed to complement Unit 1.4 of the OCR J277 GCSE spec.

In it, you will find virtual machine images (all open-source software) to use as servers to be hacked and Slax modules with the tools needed for each lesson.

## You will need

- A selection of computers running Linux. These can could be donated laptops (as is the case at my school), Raspberry Pis or even a set of VMs if you have a super fancy lab in your school.
- A solid understanding of Linux. You'll need to know your apt-get from your yum for these activities. At some point I'll try and write detailed tutorials, but for now I am assuming that you know your way around the major Linux distros.
- Some USB sticks.
- (Optional but highly desireable) A router so that you can keep these devices far, far away from the main network.
